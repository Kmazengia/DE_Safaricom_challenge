Develop RESTFUL API
=========================
1. first install IDE. Here I used Inteleji IDE
2. go to www.start.spring.io and  Install Spring boot Dependencies to the IDE which includes (Jpa, web, H2)
3. I am using postman for client request
4. Then wait the maven container to install those things 
5. begin doing folder structure to do Restful API(controller, service, employe and repo)
 controller 
 ===========
 controller is user to create get, post, delet and put mappings so that the clients can request from the lower layed, so it is used for mvc
2. services 
==============
used for logical operation
3. employee
=============
this is an entity 

4. repo
=========
this is the database
